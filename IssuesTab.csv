2	feature	TrivialAugment Integration	"Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe. So far you have integration for AutoAugment and RandAugment in the repo as well as some settings that seem to be inspired by UniformAugment and/or TrivialAugment (see 79640fc). I am the author of TrivialAugment (https://github.com/automl/trivialaugment), which was just accepted as Oral for ICCV, and used your repository for my latest experiments on EfficientNet-B1, where I saw improvements over the more complicated methods, like in the previous experiments. The current augmentation pipeline has a lot of choices, which makes it difficult to get a training going, as these have to be set first. TrivialAugment, at least in my comparison with my own RandAugment implementation, outperforms RA on EffNet-B1 without hyper-parameters. Of course, this is me pushing my own baseline for this repo (:D), but I would also totally be up to provide some not too expensive experiments to show whether an integration of TA actually makes sense. Describe the solution you'd like I would like to stick to your general augmentation setup and use what is there with the TrivialAugment algorithm. This would only mean very few lines of changes, as it is almost implemented already. One could also integrate the auglib from https://github.com/automl/trivialaugment which is what I tested so far. Describe alternatives you've considered RA and AA have hyper-parameters and performed worse in my experiments. What would you think?"
3	bug	Inquiry into feature_only setting of ghostnet backbone	Hi. We successfully introduced the ghostnet backbone from timm.  When we set feature_only as true, the structures after block 7 are ignored. The backbone works well but we are wondering if this is normal? Why these layers are abandoned?
4	feature	Multi-Label Classification	How do I apply this nice repo to Multi-Label Classification task ? That is , a image has multi labels，I'd like to get the each label's confidence.  sound like add some features in dataset.py? or more than this file?  Thanks.

6	bug	Mark Respective Books as Freely Redistributable 	Many of the books in the repository are free under various terms, or under terms which aren't made clear on the download page specifically. It might be nice if for books released under open licenses like Creative Commons or Free Documentation License, that they be marked somehow in the repository. This would be great to denote books which aren't only free, but also freely available to redistribute. For example, there have been instances where a book or resource was previously free, but is no longer available for free. Many resources in the repository which aren't under an open license may no longer be available at any given moment for new users. This would make it so it's clearer which books are certainly always going to be free, if not by the first party than by anyone that had already obtained the book under said license and has the right to continue redistributing it, vs books which must be downloaded from the website it came from with no guarantee it'll always be there.

10	feature	crosslinks proposals	PR #5525 introduces section-to-section crosslinks so that users looking for Angular books will find them whether they are looking for Angular or AngularJS. This issue asks the community: Is this a good way to make this repo more useful? Should crosslinks look different from what is being done in refactor: normalize Angular and Angular.js sections/resources #5525? When should we add a crosslink? Should Android be crosslinked with Java? When should crosslinks should NOT be added? (we need guidelines) how does this relate to Rename "Language Agnostic"? #5249 (dealing with language agnostic books)
9	feature	Question: Where to find the Expression Watcher?	I noticed in the docs that the Logs plugin is supposed to have an expression watcher. That's just what I need, but I can't find it!! The screenshot shows it in the right sidebar, but I don't have a right sidebar. In the left sidebar there are icons to toggle the left and right sidebar, but the right sidebar toggle doesn't do anything.
11	feature	Resources REST API #	I had an idea, we could take the entire database here and make an API that could serve the data based on certain requests. It can be used to get the data in a much more streamlined manner, as well as serve as a base for later creating a web app. I can personally help with this as I work with the MERN stack, I could make the API using Node.js which could be easily integrated into future web apps.
12	question	Filipino translations page required	How to add Filipino translations? Wanted to add one. Since there is no file for that at the moment. I can create one but what to name the file - free-programming-books-??.md Regards.
